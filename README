DISCLAIMER
    This is ALPHA SOFTWARE. Use at your own risk. Features may change.

    Needless to say I'm not going to steal the namespace from the upcoming
    MooseX::DBIC module - I'm happy to rename this module to anything that
    fits (just it happened that this was the first module name that came to
    my mind;-).

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to put the arguments to "add_column" in
    DBIx::Class::ResultSource right into your attribute definitions and will
    automatically call it when it finds an "add_column" attribute option. It
    also replaces the DBIx::Class-generated accessor methods (these are
    Class::Accessor::Grouped-generated accessor methods under the hood) with
    the Moose-generated accessor methods so that you can use more of the
    wonderful powers of Moose (eg. type constraints, triggers, ...).
